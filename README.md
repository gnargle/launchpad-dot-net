# Launchpad.NET

_The easy way to create applications for the NOVATION Launchpad_

**An extension of iUltimateLP's Launchpad.NET library**  
I bought a launchpad mini mk3 and their lib doesn't support it. So I changed the libary to support it and also gave it a couple of extra events (key down and key up). If you're also using a launchpad mini mk3 this will let you use it with c# (although the listing and stuff ain't quite right)

**Check the Wiki on Github for details on extra functions and events please**
